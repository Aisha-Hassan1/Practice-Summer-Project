# Last Mile Delivery Simulation

This project is a simulation for last mile delivery, where you can determine the country, city, number of stores, and number of vehicles. Each vehicle can be assigned a type (Bicycles, Motorcycles, Cars, or Vans) and a capacity. Vehicles can also have fridges with a specific capacity to store orders that require refrigeration.

The simulation involves generating a map with randomly positioned stores and vehicles. Hovering over a store or vehicle will display relevant information. Vehicles initiate with a random capacity value between 0 and their maximum capacity. As they take orders from stores, their current capacity increases. The simulation tracks the total capacity of orders they can carry.

## Features

- Selection of country, city, number of stores, and number of vehicles.
- Vehicle types: Bicycles, Motorcycles, Cars, or Vans.
- Vehicle capacity and optional fridge capacity.
- Random positioning of stores and vehicles on the map.
- Hover-over information display for stores and vehicles.
- Vehicle capacity initiation and tracking as orders are taken.
- Support for orders that require refrigeration.
- Tracking of remaining orders after delivery.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
3. Run it.
   
## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Fill in the required information for country, city, number of stores, and number of vehicles.
3. Select the vehicle type and enter the capacity and fridge details if applicable.
4. Click the "Start Simulation" button to initiate the simulation.
5. The map will be displayed with stores and vehicles positioned randomly.
6. Hover over stores or vehicles to view their information.
7. Orders will be assigned to vehicles, and their capacity will be updated accordingly.
8. After delivery, remaining orders will be displayed.
