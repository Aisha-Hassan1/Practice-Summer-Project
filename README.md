## Vehicle and Store Routing Project
This project, which was upgraded from a [simulation project](https://github.com/Aisha-Hassan1/practice-Summer-Project/tree/mariam_1), uses the Esri Leaflet library to provide routes between vehicles and storesÂ in real-time. Users can designate the locations of vehicles and stores on a map using an intuitive online interface, and the application will show the routes based on the clicks the user makes on the map.

## Features
Interactive Map Interface: Powered by the Esri Leaflet library, the project offers an interactive map interface for easy visualization and interaction.
Click-Based Selection: Users can simply click on the map to add vehicles and stores at desired locations.
Real-Time Route Updates: The application automatically updates routes in real-time based on any changes in vehicle or store positions.
Integration with ArcGIS Route Service: By leveraging the ArcGIS route service, the project ensures accurate and reliable directions for the calculated routes.

## Installation
1-Clone the repository
2-Obtain an API key from ArcGIS Developer [Get an API key](https://developers.arcgis.com/sign-up/).
3-replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual ArcGIS API key.
4-Run it


## Usage
On the map interface, simply click to add vehicles and stores at the desired locations.
As you update the positions of vehicles or stores, the routes will be automatically recalculated and displayed on the map.
